Processing GPS 

So here's the basic idea; I'm going to create a csv for each study subject with x,y,acc (accelorometer data). 
Each subject will have a diff. number of rows.

I got this Processing code to loop through all the files p*.csv (* being wildcard) and show x,y points.
I'm having a lot of trouble creating variables within loops to be able to work outside of them, basically they don't!!!

So the variable z (line 11) is what I'm trying to use to iterate through each .csv's rows and display the points.
It shows up on line 31. And then on line 62 I say z = z + 1. 

This would be okay if each .csv had the same amount of rows. But they don't. 


I'm pretty lost with this java stuff, particularly loops. 












later notes:

Not quite getting the size of the ellipse to work with the aC data... can fix that later
